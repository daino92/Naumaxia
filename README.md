# Naumaxia - Entry level game

This is a simple minesweeper look-alike game application.
As you start the game, you choose how many ships (mines) you want to have and also how many shots.
There is a table which tracks your points for hitting a ship and a table which tacks available shots.
If you win or lose, the appropriate message appears and then the application closes itself.
